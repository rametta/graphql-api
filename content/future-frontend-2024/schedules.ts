          description: `Building instant-on web applications at scale have been elusive. Real-world sites need tracking, analytics, and complex user interfaces and interactions. We always start with the best intentions but end up with a less-than-ideal site.

QwikCity is a new meta-framework that allows you to build large-scale applications with constant startup-up performance. We will look at how to build a QwikCity application and what makes it unique. The workshop will show you how to set up a QwikCity project. How routing works with layout. The demo application will fetch data and present it to the user in an editable form. And finally, how one can use authentication. All of the basic parts for any large-scale applications.

Along the way, we will also look at what makes Qwik unique, and how resumability enables constant startup performance no matter the application complexity.`,

They all have a time and place, but the best framework lets you reach for new tools only when you need that complexity. That's where Astro's "zero JS by default" comes in.

In this workshop, we'll use Astro to traverse those modern JS technologies by building a "swag" store. We'll start with plain server-rendered HTML, add authentication middleware, use React for interactive "add to cart" flows, and apply adapters to deploy to your host of choice. By the end of the day, you'll truly understand your stack to confidently ship new features.`,
